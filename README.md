# A Tutorial on Computational Resources for Bioinformatics
This tutorial is designed to familiarize undergraduate and graduate students with the computational resouces required for bioinformatics using a standard pipeline for constructuing annotated fungal genomes. Before starting, please having the following software installed: 
* VisualStudioCode or another IDE of your choice
* Docker
* Anaconda, miniconda, or another conda distribution of your choice
In this tutorial, you will learn to use both Docker and conda, so you need only have these installed.
